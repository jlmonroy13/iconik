# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Generate a comprehensive PRD for the Iconik SaaS project, taking into account all requirements, features, and technical details already described in the following PRD file. Do not duplicate what is already present, but fill in any missing best practices or SaaS-specific recommendations.

**Response:**

**Iconik SaaS Product Requirements Document (PRD) — Supplement & Best Practices**

---

## 1. Product Summary & Value Proposition

**Iconik** is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for nail spas, delivering robust tools for appointment management, service tracking, staff scheduling, inventory, sales, and client communications. The platform is designed for **scalability**, **security**, and **ease of use**, supporting multiple spas with strict data isolation and role-based access.

---

## 2. Market & User Segmentation

**Target Audience:**
- Spa Owners/Administrators: Full access to manage spa operations, users, and reporting.
- Manicurists: Access to assigned schedules, service orders, and client interactions.
- Clients: Limited access for booking, feedback, and notifications.

**User Segmentation Table:**

| User Type         | Access Level           | Primary Needs                          |
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Superadmin        | All spas, admin users | Platform setup, spa/user management    |
| Spa Admin         | Own spa               | Operations, staff, payments, reporting |
| Manicurist        | Own spa, assigned     | Service orders, schedules              |
| Client            | Own data              | Booking, feedback, notifications       |[3]

## 3. SaaS-Specific Best Practices & Recommendations

### 3.1. **Scalability & Performance**
- **Horizontal scaling**: Ensure the platform can handle growth in spas, users, and transactions without performance degradation. Use stateless API design and scalable database practices (e.g., connection pooling, read replicas)[1][2].
- **Automated deployment**: Use CI/CD pipelines for rapid, reliable deployments (Vercel integration is already in place).

### 3.2. **Security & Compliance**
- **Data isolation**: Enforce strict spaId-based multi-tenancy at all API and database layers.
- **Audit logs**: Implement audit logging for critical actions (user management, payments, service edits) to meet enterprise and regulatory requirements[4].
- **Data encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (PostgreSQL SSL, HTTPS everywhere).
- **Role-based access**: Maintain and regularly review role definitions and permissions.
- **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR compliance for client data, including data export and deletion on request.

### 3.3. **User Management & Onboarding**
- **No self-registration**: All user creation is admin-driven, reducing risk of unauthorized access.
- **Onboarding flows**: Provide clear onboarding for new spas and users, including tooltips and contextual help in Spanish.
- **User lifecycle management**: Allow admins to deactivate/reactivate users, not just delete, to preserve historical data integrity.

### 3.4. **Billing & Subscription Management**
- **Subscription tiers**: Plan for future support of multiple pricing tiers (e.g., per-seat, per-spa, feature-based).
- **Payment integration**: Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for SaaS billing, even if not required for initial launch[1].
- **Usage metrics**: Track active users, appointments, and storage per spa for billing and scaling insights.

### 3.5. **Monitoring, Logging & Observability**
- **Centralized logging**: Use a logging service (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Sentry) for error and performance monitoring.
- **Health checks**: Implement health endpoints for uptime monitoring.
- **Feature usage analytics**: Track feature adoption to inform product improvements and customer success[3].

### 3.6. **Localization & Accessibility**
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: All UI text is in Spanish; structure code to support future language additions.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Ensure all UI components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.

### 3.7. **API & Integration**
- **RESTful API design**: Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger for internal and potential third-party use[1].
- **Webhooks**: Plan for outbound webhooks (e.g., for booking, payment, feedback events) to enable spa integrations.
- **Rate limiting**: Protect APIs from abuse with per-spa and per-user rate limits.

### 3.8. **Release & Change Management**
- **Feature flags**: Use feature toggles for gradual rollout and A/B testing of new features.
- **Changelog**: Maintain a public changelog for transparency with spa admins.

## 4. User Flows & Experience

- **Booking Flow**: Client receives unique booking URL → selects service/time → confirms appointment → receives confirmation.
- **Service Order Flow**: Manicurist starts service (quick or scheduled) → records details → submits for admin payment processing.
- **Payment Flow**: Admin reviews completed service → applies discounts/split payments → finalizes transaction.
- **Feedback Flow**: Client receives feedback link post-service → submits evaluation → admin reviews feedback.
- **Recurrence Flow**: System calculates recommended return date → notifies admin (and, in future, client) → admin follows up.

---

## 5. Technical Requirements & Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, custom UI, all forms via React Hook Form.
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL (Neon), strict spaId multi-tenancy.
- **Authentication**: Auth.js (NextAuth v5), magic link via Resend.
- **Validation**: Zod for all form and API validation.
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend & API), Neon (PostgreSQL).
- **DevOps**: ESLint, TypeScript, CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 6. Metrics & KPIs

- **Active spas/users**
- **Appointments booked/completed**
- **Service order completion rate**
- **Payment success/failure rate**
- **Client feedback response rate**
- **System uptime and error rates**
- **Churn and retention rates**[3]

---

## 7. Stakeholder Collaboration & Feedback

- **Cross-functional reviews**: Involve design, engineering, and customer success in PRD reviews and feature planning[5].
- **Customer feedback loop**: Regularly collect and analyze spa admin and manicurist feedback to inform roadmap[3].
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date internal and customer-facing documentation for all features and workflows.

---

## 8. Enterprise Readiness (Future-Proofing)

- **Audit logs and reporting** for compliance.
- **Bulk user and data management** for large spas.
- **Customizable permissions** for complex spa org structures.
- **SLA and support escalation processes** for enterprise customers[4].

---

**This supplement ensures Iconik’s PRD aligns with SaaS best practices, enterprise readiness, and modern product management standards, filling in gaps not covered in the original PRD.**
