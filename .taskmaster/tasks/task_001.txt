# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with necessary configurations and tools.
# Details:
Create a new Git repository for the Iconik project. Set up the project structure with Next.js 15, React 19, and Tailwind CSS 4. Configure ESLint and TypeScript for code quality and type checking. Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository setup by checking the successful execution of initial CI/CD pipeline runs and linting checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up version control for the project by initializing a Git repository in the project directory.
### Details:
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run 'git init' to create a new Git repository. Optionally, add and commit initial files to establish the first commit.

## 2. Set Up Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install and configure Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS to establish the project's frontend framework and styling.
### Details:
Use the Next.js CLI (e.g., 'npx create-next-app@latest') to scaffold the project with React. Install Tailwind CSS and follow its setup instructions to integrate it with Next.js.

## 3. Configure ESLint and TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Add and configure ESLint for code linting and TypeScript for static type checking.
### Details:
Install ESLint and TypeScript packages. Set up configuration files (e.g., .eslintrc, tsconfig.json) to enforce code quality and enable TypeScript support in the project.

## 4. Establish CI/CD Pipelines [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
### Details:
Configure GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool to run tests, lint checks, and deploy the application automatically on code changes or pull requests.

Implementation plan for CI/CD Pipelines:

- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Create a workflow file at .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml.
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Set up Node.js (version from .nvmrc or package.json)
  3. Install dependencies with npm ci
  4. Run lint checks (npm run lint)
  5. Run tests (npm test or equivalent)
  6. Build the application (npm run build)
  7. (Optional) Deploy to Vercel or other platform if secrets are configured
- Trigger on push and pull_request to main branches.
- Add status badge to README if desired.
- Ensure pipeline fails on errors and passes on success.
- Document the workflow in README if needed.
