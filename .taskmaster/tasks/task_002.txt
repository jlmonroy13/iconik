# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Multi-Tenancy and Data Isolation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the multi-tenancy architecture ensuring data isolation for each spa.
# Details:
Use Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL to implement multi-tenancy. Ensure each API and database operation is scoped by spaId. Implement middleware to enforce spaId checks on all requests.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests to verify data isolation between different spaIds. Ensure no data leakage occurs across tenants.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Multi-Tenancy Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall multi-tenancy approach, including the level of isolation (shared database, separate schema, or separate database) and architectural patterns to ensure tenant separation and scalability.
### Details:
Analyze requirements to choose between shared database, separate schema, or separate database models. Document the architecture, including how tenants are identified and how resources are allocated.

## 2. Implement Data Isolation with Prisma ORM [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure Prisma ORM to enforce data isolation according to the chosen multi-tenancy model, ensuring that tenant data is securely separated.
### Details:
Modify Prisma models and queries to include tenant identifiers or configure separate schemas/databases as needed. Ensure that all data access is scoped to the correct tenant context.

## 3. Create Middleware for spaId Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Develop middleware that intercepts requests and validates the spaId (tenant identifier) to enforce tenant-specific access control.
### Details:
Implement middleware logic to extract and verify spaId from requests, ensuring that only authorized users can access tenant-specific resources.

## 4. Write Integration Tests for Multi-Tenancy [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Develop integration tests to verify that the multi-tenancy implementation correctly enforces data isolation and access control across tenants.
### Details:
Create test cases that simulate multiple tenants, ensuring that data cannot be accessed across tenant boundaries and that spaId checks are enforced.

## 5. Perform Complexity Analysis and Reasoning [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Analyze the complexity of the multi-tenancy solution, focusing on scalability, security, and maintainability.
### Details:
Document the trade-offs of the chosen architecture, potential bottlenecks, and strategies for scaling and securing the multi-tenant system.
