# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RBAC to manage permissions for different user roles.
# Details:
Define roles (Superadmin, Spa Admin, Manicurist, Client) and their permissions. Use Auth.js for authentication and integrate role checks in API routes. Ensure UI components respect role permissions.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for role permissions and integration tests to verify access control across different user roles.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Roles and Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document all user roles within the system and specify the permissions associated with each role. Ensure that the roles and permissions align with business requirements and security needs.
### Details:
List all possible actions on resources, assign actions to roles based on job needs, and create a clear hierarchy of roles and permissions. Document these definitions for reference by backend and frontend teams.

## 2. Integrate Role Checks in API Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement middleware or route-level checks in the backend API to enforce role-based access control. Ensure that only users with the appropriate roles and permissions can access or modify protected resources.
### Details:
Use the defined roles and permissions to secure API endpoints. Add role checks to route handlers and handle unauthorized access attempts according to security best practices.

## 3. Ensure UI Compliance with Roles [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Update the frontend application to reflect role-based permissions, ensuring that users only see and interact with UI elements and actions permitted by their assigned roles.
### Details:
Hide or disable UI components based on the user's role. Ensure that navigation, forms, and actions are consistent with backend role enforcement to prevent unauthorized operations.

## 4. Create Tests for Role Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Develop automated tests to verify that role-based permissions are correctly enforced in both the backend API and the frontend UI.
### Details:
Write tests to check role assignments, protected endpoint access, and UI visibility for different user roles. Ensure that unauthorized actions are blocked and appropriate error messages are shown.
