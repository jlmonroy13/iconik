# Task ID: 8
# Title: Establish Audit Logging and Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement audit logging for critical actions and enforce security measures.
# Details:
Log critical actions such as user management and payments. Implement data encryption and GDPR compliance measures. Use Vercel Analytics and Sentry for monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct security audits and verify audit logs through integration tests. Ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and deploy comprehensive audit logging mechanisms to track data access, system events, and user activities, ensuring logs capture user identifiers, timestamps, purposes of access, and data modifications as required for GDPR compliance.
### Details:
Logs should include data access logs (who, when, why), system event logs (authentication attempts, configuration changes), and user activity logs (data modifications, erasures). Ensure logs are tamper-proof and regularly reviewed.

## 2. Enforce Data Encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement robust data encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit, following best practices for algorithm selection, key management, and regular audits.
### Details:
Choose strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256), manage encryption keys securely (using HSMs or KMS), rotate keys regularly, and ensure encryption is integrated at both database and application levels. Test for compatibility and performance impacts.

## 3. Ensure GDPR Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Establish and document processes and technical measures to meet GDPR requirements, including data subject rights, consent management, and secure data handling.
### Details:
Implement technical and organizational measures (TOMs), maintain consent and access logs, ensure data minimization, and provide mechanisms for data erasure and access requests. Regularly review compliance documentation and update as regulations evolve.

## 4. Conduct Security Audits [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Perform regular security audits and assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of audit logging, encryption, and GDPR compliance measures.
### Details:
Schedule periodic audits to identify vulnerabilities, verify encryption and logging implementations, and ensure ongoing compliance with GDPR and internal security policies. Address findings with corrective actions.

## 5. Test and Validate Security Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Thoroughly test and validate all implemented security controls, including audit logging, encryption, and GDPR compliance processes, to ensure they function as intended and meet legal and organizational requirements.
### Details:
Conduct functional and penetration testing, simulate data access and breach scenarios, and validate that logs, encryption, and compliance workflows operate correctly. Document results and refine controls as needed.
