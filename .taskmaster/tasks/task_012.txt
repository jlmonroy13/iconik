# Task ID: 12
# Title: Define Payment Method Database Model
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the Prisma schema includes a PaymentMethod model with required fields for multi-tenancy and integration.
# Details:
Update `prisma/schema.prisma` to include: `id`, `name`, `type`, `spaId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and optional integration fields (e.g., Stripe ID). Example:
```prisma
model PaymentMethod {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  name      String
  type      String
  spaId     String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  // ...other fields
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Run Prisma migration and verify the model is created in the database. Check that all fields are present and correctly typed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update the Prisma schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the Prisma schema file (schema.prisma) to define or update the required database models, fields, and constraints as needed for the project.
### Details:
Ensure all necessary fields, data types, and relationships are accurately represented in the schema. Double-check for required fields and constraints to match the application's requirements.

## 2. Run and verify the migration [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Use Prisma Migrate to generate and apply the migration, then verify that the database schema matches the updated Prisma schema and functions as expected.
### Details:
Run `prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>` to create and apply the migration. Inspect the database to confirm the changes were applied correctly. Test application functionality to ensure the migration did not introduce issues.
