# Task ID: 14
# Title: Build Main Payment Methods List Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the main UI page for viewing and managing payment methods.
# Details:
Create `page.tsx` in `payment-methods/`. Display payment methods in a table/grid. Include actions: Edit, Delete, Create New. Use existing UI components (Card, Button, Modal). Example:
```tsx
// src/app/dashboard/payment-methods/page.tsx
import { listPaymentMethods } from './actions';
import { Button, Card, ConfirmDialog } from '@/components/ui';

export default function PaymentMethodsPage() {
  const paymentMethods = usePaymentMethods(); // Custom hook or SWR
  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>Payment Methods</h2>
      <Button href='/dashboard/payment-methods/create'>Add New</Button>
      <table>{/* Render payment methods */}</table>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Manual and automated UI tests. Verify list renders, actions are present, and RBAC is enforced.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement List UI Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface layout for displaying a list of items, ensuring usability and visual clarity. Apply best practices such as appropriate spacing, hierarchy, and responsive design for both web and mobile contexts.
### Details:
Use card or image lists for web, and single/two-line expandable lists for mobile. Incorporate filters, sorting, and clear item separation. Ensure the layout supports interactive elements for actions like edit, delete, and create.[1][3]

## 2. Integrate Data Fetching and Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Implement data fetching logic to retrieve and display list items from the backend or data source. Ensure the UI updates in response to data changes and supports loading, error, and empty states.
### Details:
Connect the UI to the data layer using appropriate APIs or data stores. Handle asynchronous data loading, error handling, and real-time updates if necessary. Ensure IDs and data types are correctly managed for integration reliability.[2][3]

## 3. Implement Action Handling (Edit, Delete, Create) [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Enable user actions for editing, deleting, and creating list items. Ensure these actions are reflected in both the UI and the underlying data source, with appropriate feedback and error handling.
### Details:
Wire up UI controls (buttons, forms, etc.) to trigger edit, delete, and create operations. Update the list in real time after actions complete. Provide user feedback for success or failure, and handle edge cases such as invalid input or failed operations.[3]
