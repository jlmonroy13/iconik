# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Payment Integration Fields
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13, 15, 16
# Priority: low
# Description: Add support for external payment provider integration (e.g., Stripe) if required.
# Details:
Add fields to model and forms for external IDs (e.g., Stripe payment method ID). On create/edit, optionally sync with provider. On delete, ensure method is not in use or archive instead of hard delete.

# Test Strategy:
Test integration field handling, provider sync, and deletion logic. Verify data consistency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update Data Model for Integration Fields [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the existing data model to include new fields required for integration with external providers. Ensure that the model supports tracking of provider-specific metadata and any additional attributes needed for synchronization.
### Details:
This includes schema changes, migration scripts, and updates to validation logic. Consider how new fields will interact with existing data and ensure backward compatibility where necessary.

## 2. Implement Provider Sync Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Develop the logic to synchronize data between the internal system and external providers. Handle data consistency, error handling, and ensure that changes in either system are reflected accurately.
### Details:
This involves implementing mechanisms for tracking change history, managing per-client state, and resolving conflicts. Consider strategies for soft deletes and how to efficiently handle large volumes of changes without overwhelming the system.[3]

## 3. Handle Deletion and Archival Processes [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Design and implement processes for deleting or archiving records, ensuring that deletions are handled consistently across both the internal system and external providers.
### Details:
Decide between hard and soft deletes based on sync requirements. Implement archival logic if full deletion is not feasible due to sync or audit constraints. Ensure that deletion/archival actions are propagated to external providers and that data integrity is maintained.[3][4]
