# Task ID: 20
# Title: Write Unit, Integration, and E2E Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive test coverage for all payment methods management features.
# Details:
Write unit tests for server actions (CRUD). Write integration tests for API endpoints. Write E2E tests for UI flows (create, edit, delete, list). Write RBAC tests to ensure only authorized roles can mutate.

# Test Strategy:
Run all tests and verify coverage. Ensure all edge cases (RBAC, spaId, validation, deletion prevention) are tested.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Unit Test Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and implement unit tests to ensure all critical code paths and logic branches are covered, leveraging code coverage metrics and complexity analysis.
### Details:
Focus on achieving high coverage for individual functions and modules, using cyclomatic complexity to identify areas needing additional tests. Ensure tests are automated and integrated into the CI pipeline.

## 2. Define Integration Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Design and execute integration tests to validate interactions between modules and services, ensuring correct data flow and interface contracts.
### Details:
Identify key integration points and create test cases that simulate real-world data and workflows. Use structured testing techniques to cover integration complexity and edge cases.

## 3. Implement E2E UI Flow Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Develop end-to-end UI tests to verify that user-facing workflows function as expected from the frontend through to backend systems.
### Details:
Automate UI flows covering major user journeys, including positive and negative scenarios. Ensure tests are robust against UI changes and validate system behavior across layers.

## 4. Create RBAC and Multi-Tenancy Test Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Design and execute test cases for role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-tenancy, focusing on authorization, isolation, and cross-tenant edge cases.
### Details:
Test various user roles and tenant boundaries, including attempts to access unauthorized resources. Validate compliance with security and policy requirements.

## 5. Compile Test Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4
### Description: Document all test strategies, scenarios, coverage metrics, and results for unit, integration, E2E, and RBAC/multi-tenancy tests.
### Details:
Ensure documentation is clear, comprehensive, and accessible for future maintenance and audits. Include complexity analysis reasoning and test coverage reports.
